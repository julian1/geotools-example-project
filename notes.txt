A simple count is available:

SimpleFeatureType schema = featureSource.getSchema();
Query query = new Query( schema.getTypeName(), Filter.INCLUDE );
int count = featureSource.getCount( query );
if( count == -1 ){
  // information was not available in the header!
  SimpleFeatureCollection collection = featureSource.getFeatures( query );
  count = collection.size();
}
System.out.println("There are "+count+" "+schema.getTypeName()+ " features");




The bounding box, or extend, of a set of features:

SimpleFeatureType schema = featureSource.getSchema();
Query query = new Query( schema.getTypeName(), Filter.INCLUDE );
BoundingBox bounds = featureSource.getBounds( query );
if( bounds == null ){
   // information was not available in the header
   FeatureCollection<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature> collection = featureSource.getFeatures( query );
   bounds = collection.getBounds();
}
System.out.println("The features are contained within "+bounds );





Ad-hoc summary information is available using aggregate functions for feature collections:

SimpleFeatureCollection collection = featureSource.getFeatures();

FilterFactory2 ff = CommonFactoryFinder.getFilterFactory2(null);
Function sum = ff.function("Collection_Sum", ff.property("population"));

Object value = sum.evaluate( featureCollection );
System.out.println("total population: "+ sum );
